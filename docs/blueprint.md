## Style Guidelines:

- Pure black (#000000) to create a stark cosmic backdrop.
- Cosmic blue (#1E90FF) to invoke a sense of deep space, adding depth without being overly vibrant.
- Cosmic purple (#5e3a87), analogous to the blue, will draw attention to key interactive elements.
- White (#FFFFFF) for primary text ensures readability, while soft gray will be used for secondary information to maintain contrast without harshness.
- 'Inter', a sans-serif, will provide a modern, clean, and readable typeface appropriate to both headlines and body text.
- Use subtle animations like fade-ins on scroll, glowing hover effects, and smooth transitions to enhance user engagement and create a dynamic, dark mode-friendly interface.
- Implement a mobile-responsive layout with smooth scrolling, a sticky navbar, and a 'Back to Top' button to ensure seamless navigation and accessibility on all devices.
